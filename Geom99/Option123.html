<h2> Blue Fish Cave, Yukon: 24,000 years ago </h2>
<p> The site was originally excavated by archaeologist Jacques Cinq-Mars between 1977 and 1987. 
This was, and still is, a very controversial site within the archaeological record due to radio-carbon dating methods. 
However, as of 2017 Université de Montréal's Department of Anthropology has published information that there is evidence of human 
occupation as of the Pleistocene era (2,580,000 to 11,700 years ago) </p>
